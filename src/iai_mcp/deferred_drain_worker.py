"""Spawn-context worker that drains one byte-bounded batch of deferred-capture
files into the store.

The parent sends only file paths and a store-root path over the pipe. The child
constructs its OWN ``MemoryStore`` and derives the at-rest encryption key
in-process from the on-disk key material — no key bytes ever cross the process
boundary. Each child drains its batch via ``capture_turn`` (forwarding every
event's ``source_uuid`` and ``ts`` unchanged so a re-drain reinforces instead of
double-inserting), reports its own counts and PID, and exits so the OS reclaims
its peak resident set between batches.

Crash-rotation backlogs are dominated by duplicates: the same conversations are
re-queued every time the writer dies, so the overwhelming majority of enumerated
events already exist in the store. ``capture_turn`` embeds (the expensive Rust
BERT step) BEFORE its idem-tag dedup check, so draining a duplicate-heavy
backlog through it alone would embed every duplicate only to discard it — and
would re-reinforce each already-present record once per duplicate, corrupting the
reinforcement signal. The per-event loop therefore runs a cheap pre-embed
idem-tag check for conversational episodic events: if the tag already exists
(in this run or in the store), the event is skipped before any embedding. The
tag is computed with the same helpers ``capture_turn`` uses, so it matches
exactly; ``capture_turn``'s own idem-check remains the correctness backstop, so
the pre-check can only save work, never drop a genuinely-new record.

Top-level import surface is only ``from __future__ import annotations``. All
compute-side imports live inside the worker body so the spawn-context child's
import does not drag store/capture modules at module-import time.
